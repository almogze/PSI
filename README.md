Point Source Interferometer Experiment, of Atom-Chip, BGU
This GUI application developed to the welfare of the PSI experiment team, and to the all colleagues in Atom Chip group.
The application include 3 main parts: 
1)  Pure graphic user interface code which can be found under gui -> uis -> pages. In order to edit those files I used QTdesigner.
2)  Transletion of the code into classes and setup procedures that will enable easier interface between the pages to the rest of the code.
    this can be found at gui -> uis -> windows.
3)  Code that act as application proccess intarface and as can be expected it locate in gui -> uis -> api.
